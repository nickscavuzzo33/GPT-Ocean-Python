# OceanProtocol-ETHMIAMI
ETH Miami Ocean Data Challenge Content and Instructions 


## Objective 
In this challenge, you will be asked to predict the value of ________ in 13 different time intervals between the hours of 10am and 12pm on October 29th (the last hackathon day)
This challenge presents a fantastic opportunity to collaborate and compete against top data scientists globally and join the Ocean Protocol Data Science initiative to 1) Empower the data scientist community and 2) Grow the adoption of Ocean Technology.

## Challenge Specs
Repo Includes ReadMEs for How to:
Get tokens

Install PDR-backend

Set Envars

Set-up dynamic model

Set PM2 bot

PDR-backend requirnments.txt

Folder that includes all files necessary for the dynamic model creation

Any other scripts or config files necessary to run a local predictoor bot on remote network with a dynamic model

Step 1 Run a [dynamic model predictoor](https://github.com/nickscavuzzo33/OceanProtocol-ETHMIAMI/blob/main/dynamic-model%20.md)

Step 2 Build your model 

Step 3 Run your Model 

Step 4 Install [Ocean.py](https://github.com/nickscavuzzo33/OceanProtocol-ETHMIAMI/blob/main/installoceanpy.md) (relevant files attached in repo) and deploy your answers inside a dataNFT

There are a few outlets to building the dynamic rediction bot. The simple route is to use a local predictoor in a remote testnet. To begin your process, you can start by starting local predictoor, local network (batge) then go to local predictoor, remote testnet. 

## User Competition Flow 
Git clone  PDR-Predictoor

Get tokens

Install PDR Backend

Set all envars

Go into the Dynamic model section and make adjustments to code as needed to customize model

Deploy PM2 bot to begin producing predictions
